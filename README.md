# WPtranspo
**Transport Wordpress Export XML File to MODX Revolution**

This is a standalone tutorial package, NOT an Extra you install via the Manager.

>Just Download the zip, add it to your root MODX install, run it and then delete it.


## Possible error points

1. the script assumes no database table prefix names. It's looking for `modx_site_content` etc.
